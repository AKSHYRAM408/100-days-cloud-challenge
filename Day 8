Set Up a Virtual Machine in the Cloud Create a freetier AWS, Azure, or GCP account. Launch a virtual 
machine and SSH into it.

Introduction
Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses manage IT resources. In this task, we will focus on 
deploying a virtual machine (VM) in the cloud. This hands-on activity will provide an understanding of 
cloud platforms, virtual machine provisioning, and secure SSH access.
Objectives
1. Understand the concept of cloud computing and VMs.
2. Create a free-tier account on a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
3. Launch a Linux virtual machine.
4. Connect to the VM securely using SSH.
Steps
1. Create a Free-Tier Cloud Account:
o Sign up for a free-tier account on AWS, Azure, or GCP.
o Verify your account to access free-tier services.
2. Launch a Virtual Machine:
o Access the cloud provider’s dashboard.
o Create a new Linux VM instance.
o Configure the instance with basic settings such as region, operating system, and instance 
type.
3. Connect to the Virtual Machine:
o Retrieve the public IP address of your VM.
o Use the following SSH command to connect:
ssh <user>@<IP_address>
Replace <user> with the default username for your chosen cloud provider (e.g., ec2-user for 
AWS) and <IP_address> with your VM’s public IP.
Key Learnings
• Basics of cloud computing.
• Creating and configuring a virtual machine.
• Using SSH to access remote servers securely.
Document 2: Hosting a Static Website on a Cloud VM
Introduction
Hosting a static website on a cloud virtual machine is a fundamental step in understanding web server setup. 
This task demonstrates how to install a web server, configure it, and deploy a static HTML website.
Objectives
1. Learn how to install and configure a web server (Apache or Nginx).
2. Transfer static website files to the server.
3. Serve the static website over the internet.
Steps
1. Connect to the Cloud VM:
o Use the SSH command to access your cloud VM.
ssh <user>@<IP_address>
2. Install Apache or Nginx:
o Update the package list:
sudo apt update
o Install Apache:
sudo apt install apache2 -y
OR Install Nginx:
sudo apt install nginx -y
3. Transfer HTML Files to the VM:
o Use SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) to transfer files:
scp index.html <user>@<IP_address>:/var/www/html/
4. Configure the Web Server:
o Ensure the web server is running:
sudo systemctl start apache2
OR
sudo systemctl start nginx
o Access the website using the VM’s public IP in a browser: http://<IP_address>.
Key Learnings
• Basics of web servers (Apache/Nginx).
• Transferring files using SCP.
• Hosting a static website on a cloud VM
